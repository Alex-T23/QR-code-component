## My process

I started by creating a div container to center the whole card, then continued with applying the styles to the background, image and texts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

By creating this QR component, I think it will be very useful in the future, as I can use this as a template in other websites or even a QR code generator, which nowadays are very useful for mobile devices.
